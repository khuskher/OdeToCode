                        <h3>Welcome to the Crime Glance Dashboard, where you can access real-time information and
                            statistics on crime in your area. Our goal is to provide you with the information you need
                            to stay informed and stay safe. <br> <br>

                            The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of crime trends in your community, including
                            information on the types of crimes that are most prevalent, the areas where crime is most
                            likely to occur, and the times of day when crimes are most likely to take place. <br> <br>


                            You can use the dashboard to stay informed about crime trends in your area, and to take
                            steps to protect yourself and your property. For example, if you notice that there has been
                            an increase in burglaries in your neighborhood, you might want to consider installing a
                            security system or taking other steps to secure your home. <br><br>

                            In addition to providing information on crime trends, the dashboard also offers tips and
                            resources for staying safe. You can access information on how to report a crime, how to
                            protect yourself from identity theft and other forms of fraud, and how to stay safe when
                            walking or driving in your neighborhood. <br><br>

                            Overall, the Crime Awareness Dashboard is a powerful tool for staying informed and staying
                            safe. By using the information and resources available through the dashboard, you can take
                            steps to protect yourself, your family, and your community from crime.</h3>
